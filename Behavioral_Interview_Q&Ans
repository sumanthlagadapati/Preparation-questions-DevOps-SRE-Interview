Behavioral Interview Questions and Answers
Why do you want to work at our company?
I like that you deal with some of the most technical problems in AWS. I was talking to my friend Bhaskar the other day who is part of your engineering team, and was impressed by all the interesting tools he goes to play with in DevOps world . I look forward to growing with the company and exploring the frontier of Cloud DevOps problems
Tip:  Know your role

What are you most proud of?
I take the most pride in organizing a weekly peer learning session among the engineers in my department.  Each engineer used to all build different features individually and sometimes we would end up building a component that had been built before. The individualistic nature of our work hampered our productivity. Since I launched the peer learning session, however, everybody can share the tools they used, and more importantly the reusable modules they've built. This learning session has become one of the most liked meetings in my team, and has largely contributed to us becoming the most productive engineer team in the company.
Tip: Know yourself

How do you deal with situation X?
I love a fast paced working environment, and think that it pushes me to grow faster as an individual as well. Previously I was working with an ad agency to manage their in house experimentation systems. The system was designed to only support one variant at a time. As the company grew, however I noticed that we got more and bigger customers that requested multi-variant experimentations through a lot of customer interviews and in-bound requests. While it was pretty challenging to build such a complex system automatic reporting, I understood that it was a necessary step to unlock the next level of growth, so I re-prioritized our feature requests and put together a convincing demo with my team. That demo ultimately paved way for few multi million dollar deals
