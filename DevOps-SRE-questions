**Recreate Strategy:**
- Terminates all existing pods before creating new ones.
- Causes downtime as all old pods are deleted simultaneously.
- Used when new deployments require a complete restart.

**Rolling Update Strategy:**
- Gradually replaces old pods with new ones to ensure zero downtime.
- Uses `maxUnavailable` and `maxSurge` parameters to control rollout.
- Preferred for production environments where uptime is critical.

## 52. Why is Kubernetes widely used in modern organizations?
- Automates container deployment, scaling, and operations.
- Provides high availability and fault tolerance.
- Works well with microservices architectures.
- Enables multi-cloud and hybrid cloud environments.

## 53. What are Cluster IP, Headless Services, and when should you use them?
**Cluster IP:**
- Default service type.
- Exposes the service within the Kubernetes cluster.
- Used for internal communication between pods.

**Headless Service:**
- Defined with `clusterIP: None`.
- Does not allocate a virtual IP.
- Used when clients need direct access to individual pod IPs (e.g., StatefulSets, databases).

## 54. What are stateless and stateful in YAML files?
**Stateless Applications:**
- Do not persist data between sessions.
- Can be freely restarted and scaled.
- Example: Web servers, API services.

**Stateful Applications:**
- Maintain state across restarts.
- Require persistent storage (e.g., databases, messaging queues).
- Deployed using StatefulSets in Kubernetes.

## 55. What are the different Kubernetes services, and how do they work?
- **ClusterIP:** Internal access only.
- **NodePort:** Exposes service on a static port on each node.
- **LoadBalancer:** Uses a cloud provider's load balancer to expose services externally.
- **Headless Service:** No ClusterIP, directly resolves to pod IPs.

## 56. What is a Terraform state file, and why is it important?
- Stores the current state of infrastructure.
- Tracks resources managed by Terraform.
- Helps in detecting changes and preventing configuration drift.

## 57. What resources have you created using Terraform?
- AWS EC2 instances, VPCs, subnets, security groups.
- RDS instances, S3 buckets, IAM roles.
- Kubernetes clusters (EKS, GKE, AKS).
- Load balancers, Route 53 DNS records.

## 58. If an RDS instance is created via Terraform but later modified manually, how do you reconcile the changes?
- Run `terraform plan` to detect drift.
- Use `terraform apply` to override manual changes.
- If needed, import the changes using `terraform import`.

## 59. What is a Terraform local name, and how is it used?
- Defined using `locals` block in Terraform.
- Used to store reusable expressions.
- Example:
  ```hcl
  locals {
    env = "dev"
  }
  output "environment" {
    value = local.env
  }
  ```

## 60. What are Docker Volumes, and why use them instead of EC2 storage?
- Persist data across container restarts.
- Decoupled from the container lifecycle.
- Can be shared among multiple containers.
- More flexible than EC2 instance storage.

## 61. Is Docker volume data persistent?
- Yes, data in Docker volumes persists even if containers are stopped or removed.

## 62. How do you implement a CI/CD pipeline? Can you write a Jenkins pipeline?
- Steps:
  1. Code is pushed to GitHub.
  2. Jenkins detects changes and triggers a build.
  3. Builds artifacts and runs tests.
  4. Deploys to a Kubernetes cluster.

- **Jenkinsfile Example:**
  ```groovy
  pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
      stage('Build') {
        steps {
          sh 'mvn clean package'
        }
      }
      stage('Test') {
        steps {
          sh 'mvn test'
        }
      }
      stage('Deploy') {
        steps {
          sh 'kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml'
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

## 63. Why use ArgoCD for Kubernetes deployments? How does it work end to end?
- **Why ArgoCD?**
  - GitOps approach for Kubernetes deployments.
  - Ensures cluster state matches Git repository.
  - Provides a UI and audit trail for deployments.

- **How it works:**
  1. Define Kubernetes manifests in a Git repository.
  2. ArgoCD continuously monitors the repo.
  3. If drift is detected, ArgoCD syncs changes.
  4. Ensures Kubernetes deployments are always in the desired state.

## 64. How do you establish communication between frontend and backend services?
- Use Kubernetes services (ClusterIP, LoadBalancer, Ingress).
- Example: Backend as a service exposed via ClusterIP.
- Frontend connects via service name (`http://backend-service:8080`).

## 65. What are the key services used in your project?
- Kubernetes (EKS/GKE/AKS), ArgoCD, Prometheus, Grafana.
- Terraform for infrastructure as code.
- CI/CD tools like Jenkins/GitHub Actions.
- Database services (RDS, PostgreSQL, MongoDB).

## 66. When do you use headless services vs. cluster services?
- **Headless Services:** When direct pod-to-pod communication is needed (e.g., databases, stateful applications).
- **ClusterIP Services:** When internal service discovery is sufficient.

## 67. What’s the best way to deploy and manage microservices in a Kubernetes environment?
- Use **Helm charts** for packaging microservices.
- Implement **ArgoCD/GitOps** for deployment automation.
- Set up **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler** for scalability.

🔹 Linux Interview Q&A
1. How do you check running processes in Linux?

Common commands:

ps aux          # Show all processes with details
ps -ef          # Full-format listing
top             # Real-time view of processes
htop            # Interactive, colored version of top


For filtering:

ps -ef | grep java    # Find Java processes
pgrep nginx           # Find PID of nginx

2. What’s the difference between top, htop, and ps?

ps: Snapshot of processes at a given time (not real-time).

top: Real-time monitoring (CPU/memory usage).

htop: Advanced version of top → interactive UI, scrolling, sorting, and killing processes easily.

3. How to schedule a cron job every 15 minutes?

Edit crontab:

crontab -e


Add entry:

*/15 * * * * /path/to/script.sh


👉 Runs script every 15 minutes.

4. What is the difference between hard link and soft link?

Hard Link:

Points directly to the inode of a file.

File still exists even if original is deleted.

Cannot span across filesystems.

Example:

ln file1 file2


Soft Link (Symbolic Link):

Points to the path of the original file.

Breaks if the target is deleted.

Can span filesystems.
Example:
ln -s file1 file2

5. How to find which process is using high memory?

Using top or htop, sort by memory usage (M).
Or with ps:
ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -10
